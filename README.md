# Kinota&trade;

Kinota&trade; is a modular open-source implmentation of
[OGC SensorThings API Part 1: Sensing](http://docs.opengeospatial.org/is/15-078r6/15-078r6.html);
referred to as "STA" hereafter.  Kinota was developed to support multiple persistence backends including traditional
RDBMS as as well as NoSQL databases; currently the only persistence backend is for Apache Cassandra.

## Modules

Kinota is made up of the following sub-projects/modules.

### kinota-commons

kinota-commons includes base classes defining STA objects (e.g. Thing, Location, Datastream, etc.; these base classes
also know how to serialize themselves to JSON) as well as high-level service layer definitions for performing CRUD
operations for each STA object (including JSON deserialization).  The commons module also includes REST service
definitions (which are built using Jersey), as well as other utility and helper classes and methods that are shared
or likely to be shared across modules.

### kinota-persistence-cassandra

kinota-persistence-cassandra is the persistence backend for Apache Cassandra.

### kinota-rest-cassandra

kinota-rest-cassandra defines a Spring Boot application used to deploy an STA REST API with data stored in an Apache
Cassandra cluster.  kinota-rest-cassandra also includes an implementation of JSON Web Token (JWT) authentication for
limiting access to CUD (create, update, delete) operations.  Note that in the near future we plan to split JWT
authentication components into a separate module (e.g. cassandra-security-jwt).

## Requirements

Kinota requires the following:
* Java 8
* Maven 3
* Apache Cassandra 3.x (to use the default Cassandra persistence backend)

### Maven configuration

Coming soon!

### Development

Unit and integration tests use an embedded version of Apache Cassandra to allow easy development from a single
developer machine.
